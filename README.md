# Team Profile Generator

This was an assignment to create a Day planner using CSS, Java and HTML, Node. I wrote this using VSC (Visual Studio Code).

## Purpose

I built this application for a software engineering team to generate team information via a command-line application automatically.  The program will prompt the user for information regarding the employee and information regarding the team members.  It can be a mix of managers, engineers and interns, and the application will sort through the data. This assignment also has unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a pleasantly formatted team membership based on the user's information.
